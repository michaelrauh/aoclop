Read file 2 and parse it into one list of numbers by ','. First, replace the first number with 12 and replace the second number with 2. Then, iterating in blocks of 4, read the first number. If it is 99, stop. If it is 1, add the numbers at the addresses pointed to by the numbers in the next two slots. Write the result to the location pointed to by the last slot. If it is two, multiply. Then, put out the first value.
